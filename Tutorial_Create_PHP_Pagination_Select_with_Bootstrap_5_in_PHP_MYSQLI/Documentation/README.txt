Tutorial |  Create PHP Pagination (Select) with Bootstrap 5 in PHP & MYSQLI


Basic setup for example:

Prep: at the top of the example index.php file you will need to edit your db connection details:

$mysqli = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'db_user', 'db_password', 'db_name');

Ie:

db_user
db_password
db_name

1) copy contents of db.sql into a db in say php admin for example

2) upload the index.php file to your localhost or server

3) viola! You can now see the example and hopefully get the general idea of how such is done.

4) edit the index.php file and db.sql files and such for your own usages.

Note: if the select popup is not your desire you can comment that functionality out and uncomment the commented section for disabled and such will still function just without the select popup.

Best of Luck!
