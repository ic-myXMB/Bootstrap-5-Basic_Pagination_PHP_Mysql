Tutorial |  Create PHP Pagination with Bootstrap 5 in PHP & MYSQLI


Basic setup for example:


Prep: at the top of the example index.php file you will need to edit your db connection details:

$mysqli = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'db_user', 'db_password', 'db_name');

Ie:

db_user
db_password
db_name

1) Visit the included index.html and read setup for db instructions. 
1 - ALT) else copy contents of db.sql into a db in say php admin for example

2 - Prep) find the upload folder and files included as those could / should be copied to your desired locale
2 - A) upload the index.html file to your localhost or server
2 - B) upload the index.php file to your localhost or server

3) viola! You can now see the example and hopefully get the general idea of how such is done.

4) edit the index.php file and db.sql files and such for your own usages.


Best of luck!
